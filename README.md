League Of Legends Memory Game

Hi! Welcome to my website, I myself have always been a player of the game League of Legends, but sometimes I was left wondering to myself,
What if there were more games that were related to it? Because I think its satisfying to see characters of my favorite game pop up in
different ones and be able to recognize them, I mean who doesnt like seeing more of their favorites?

So thats why when I was tasked with this project I was wondering for a bit about what I am supposed to do or where do I want to go with this?
I was looking for differnt project ideas and was contemplating just making a normal memory game as it was one of the recommended and suggested
options. Not knowing what to do the thought to just leave it here and ponder over it while I play some League of Legends came to mind but then
the thought hit me, if im going to play league anyway why don't I just make my project League based? So thats how we all ended up here.


UX

This website is intended for the same reason most memory games are, for people that just enjoy playing memory games or people that would like
to train their memories, however I decided to make my memory game in a way to appeal moreso to people that play video games and enjoy gamey
aspects, especially people that play League of Legends. By trying to make it count the amounts of times you tried to match them all up I 
hope for players to set their own goals of how fast they can complete the game tries wise. I also added different difficulty levels so 
that if one is too hard or too easy you can find a difficulty that could match you more easily and who knows maybe youll be able to complete
the hardest difficulty in but a few tries after a bit!!


Features

Feature 1 - difficulty settings
3 different difficulty settings that allow people to go from easy to medium to hard to find one that they want to play at the time, made it easy 
to click on them by using colors that generally tend to represent them.

Feature 2 - The board
Allows people to try to match the pictures on the board in sets of 2 to try and completely match the entire board, if they get a wrong pair they
flip back and have to try to memorize where they were in order to match them when they find a pair! When the board is completed a modal with pop up
congratulating the player on their victory before it resets the board allowing them to play again.

Feature 3 - Reset button
A button that allows someone if they know they arent going to make it in the amount of tries that they either have set for themselves or their goal is 
to reset the map, setting back their try counter to 0, unflipping all the cards and re-randomizing all of them and making them all selectable again.

Feature 4 - try counter
This counter allows the user to keep track of how many times they have tried to match the cards.

Feature 5 - Footer links
These links have a few different uses, being
- Contact link, allows users to contact me to ask questions, give suggestions, report problems etc.
- League of Legends page, for anyone that would like more information about League of Legends they can look at it here!
- League of Legends champions, a link to a site displaying all the characters League of Legends has, for if someone were to want to take 
a look as to where I got my inspiration from or just wants to see more artwork of the game.


Technologies Used

- JQuery is used by the website to simplify DOM manipulation, however its only used in a select few places.
- Bootstrap grid is used for the structure of the layout of the webpage, although it ended up making the javascript significantly harder
for me to do what I wanted since the shuffling is harder when you cant simply use style.order since all the cards are seperated in rows in a container

Testing

1. Cards:
    i. Try to double click the cards
    ii. Try to click on other cards before the cards clicked on first return to their original from
    iii. Try to click on a card of a pair that had already been matched
    iv. Try to refresh the page to make sure the map is shuffled differently

2. Links:
    i. Try to click the contact link to make sure that it works as intended
    ii. try to click the League of Legends to take you to their home page
    iii. Try to click the champions link to make sure it takes you to the list of champions
